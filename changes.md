# List of changes included in version 4.22 beta

> LUA script rework

The methology used in the script was simplified, thanks to the input of Lyravega. AMUMSS will no longer report warnings on empty EXML Change Tables.

> New verbiage for Solar Panel Power stat on life support upgrades

The stat in question is confusing to many players. I opted to use simpler terms: Daytime Efficiency. This label still gives the general idea of the bonus provided and it allows to keep the + sign on numerical value of the stat.

> New verbiage for "cannot change difficulty at this time"

If the player takes part in a Nexus mission or is in group with other players, the game prevents them from changing their current difficulty settings. The message displayed on a greyed out button has been modified to reflect those scenarios.

> New labels for survey missions

A continuation of the fix presented in live version. Multiple labels for missions that target specific planets were altered to include an icon and new line operator to prevent them from getting stuck one right after another. In addition, new labels for "Activated <Metal> Detected" missions were added - the text properties for them were shared with other UI elements, such as the OSD message or the planetary marker. This allowed these labels to be changed without breaking other UI elements.

> Fixed typos

* fixed typo in British spelling of word "practise" (verb) in "Practise language skills" prompts
