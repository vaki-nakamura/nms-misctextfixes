# nms-misctextfixes
A mod aiming to fix various text inconsistencies, misleading descriptions and typos found in No Man's Sky. Mod affecting only English language files. Idea by FriendlyFirePL.

# Changes

> New save message for Multiplayer and Nexus mission scenarios

The existing messages can be misleading, since the only thing that is properly saved is player's inventory state. These new messages should reflect that.

> Minotaur AI module description

Both the Hardframe Body and the standalone AI module mention minotaur being capable of "mining activities", where no such mechanics are present in the game. This info was removed from descriptions.

> New label for old derelict freighters

Currently there are 2 types of derelict freighter space encounters present in the game. The old derelicts, broken in half, with no landing pads, denoted by the red icon, and the derelicts added with Desolation update with proc-gen interiors that can be explored. This can lead to some confusion, hence my idea to rename the former type to Destroyed Freighters.

> Changes to survey missions' labels

Labels used for local system survey missions (scanning flora, fauna, minerals) did not use line break characters, which made it possible for them to "stick" to one another when multiple missions took place on the same planet. We added icons and line breaks to improve readability of these labels.

> various typos fixed

* multiple instances of typos in word "commercial" (buying frigates, pirate mission tooltips, settlementt policy event)
* typo in Cargo Scan Deflector message
* typo in one of the names showed in death screen messages (Kurt Vonnegut)
